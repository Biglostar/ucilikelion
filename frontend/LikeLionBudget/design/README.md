# Design & Planning

This directory contains early design artifacts used to plan the structure,
user flow, and UI direction of the iOS budgeting app.

The focus of these designs is clarity, simplicity, and scalability, ensuring
that UI decisions align with underlying data models and future feature expansion.

---

## User Flow

The user flow outlines how a user moves through the app from daily expense tracking
to higher-level spending summaries. The goal is to minimize friction while keeping
budget information easily accessible.

---

## Information Architecture

The information architecture defines how budgeting data (transactions, categories,
summaries) is organized and surfaced across different screens.

This structure helps guide both UI implementation and data modeling decisions.

---

## Wireframes

Wireframes are used to explore layout, hierarchy, and interaction patterns for key
screens, including the home view, calendar-based views, and summary pages.

These designs serve as a reference during SwiftUI implementation and iteration.
