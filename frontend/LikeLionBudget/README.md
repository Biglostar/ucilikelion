# iOS Budgeting App (SwiftUI)
An iOS budgeting application exploring how clean UI architecture, structured data models,
and AI-assisted insights can be combined in a practical mobile product.

This project focuses not only on user-facing features, but also on building a maintainable
foundation that separates UI, data handling, and future AI-driven logic.

---

## Project Status
In active development.  
Core UI flows and app architecture are being implemented, with ongoing iteration on data models
and budgeting logic.

---

## Overview
The goal of this project is to go beyond a basic expense tracker by helping users better
understand their spending patterns and financial behavior through clear visualizations and
intelligent feedback.

Key areas of focus include:
- Clear and intuitive budgeting flows
- Structured transaction and category data models
- Scalable architecture that can support AI-assisted insights
- Thoughtful UX design for daily financial decision-making

---

## My Role
- Designing the overall app architecture and data flow
- Implementing core budgeting screens using **SwiftUI**
- Defining data models for transactions, categories, and summaries
- Exploring how AI-assisted logic can be integrated into spending insights
- Iterating on UI/UX based on usability and clarity

> This project is being developed collaboratively, with my focus primarily on app structure,
UI implementation, and data modeling.

## Planned Features
- Budget and expense tracking
- Calendar-based spending visualization
- Categorization of transactions
- Summary views for spending patterns
- AI-assisted insights and suggestions (planned extension)

---

## Tech Stack
- **Swift**
- **SwiftUI**
- MVVM-inspired UI architecture
- Local data modeling and persistence (initial phase)
- AI-assisted insight logic (planned extension)

---

## Design & Planning
Early user flows, screen planning, and design references can be found in the `/design` directory.

---

## Project Structure

The project is organized using a feature-based structure to keep UI logic,
state handling, and data flow clearly separated.

- `Features/` contains SwiftUI views grouped by core app features
  (Home, Calendar, Transactions)
- `Model/` defines core data models and stores used across the app
- Shared state and mock data are centralized to support iterative UI development

This structure was chosen to keep the codebase scalable as features grow
and to make collaboration easier in a team environment.

---

## Next Steps
- Finalize core budgeting flows

---
- Expand data models and summaries
- Implement additional UI states and interactions
- Begin integrating AI-assisted logic for spending insights
